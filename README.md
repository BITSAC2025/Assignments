## Assignments for Introduction to Static Program Analysis.

- After completing the code assignemts in the corresponding subdirectories, you can go to the root direction, i.e., `Assignments/`, and type:

	- `./build.sh`: to compile and build the code in all subdirectories; or
	- `./build.sh [list_of_directories]`: to compile and build the code in the subdirectories you specified.

- After running `./build.sh`, an executable is expected to be in each corresponding subdirectory.

- Then, you can use the test cases in `Assignment.../Test-Cases` to check whether you code is correct.
